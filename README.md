### What is it?
It makes a contact sheet for all video files in a given folder if one doesn't exist.
It's written in Python so it should run in all OS (Windows, Mac, Linux).
### How's it work?
You set a bunch of settings in a configuration file, then it runs like this:

Then you get this:

But due to my lack of know-how in python packaging, there is a good amount of setting up first, a lot of it in command prompt (cmd) / terminal.
Still up for it?  Detailed setup instructions are below...
### Setup for Windows
**Step 1 - Install Python**
Assuming python is not installed, go and install python 2.7.
Current version is 3.7, but this app was written in 2.7.  I have not tested this app in 3.7.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/
Select the appropriate installer, you'll mostly likely use [64bit msi](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.16/python-2.7.16.amd64.msi).
Just use the default installation options, but make sure python in added to Windows PATH.
Verify python is installed by opening command prompt, and type `python --version`:
